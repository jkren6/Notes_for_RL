# Rich's Slogan

* **Approximate the solution, not the problem \(no special cases\)**
* **Drive from the problem**
* **Take the agent’s point of view**
* **Don’t ask the agent to achieve what it can’t measure**
* **Don't ask the agent to know what it can't verify**
* **Set measurable goals for subparts of the agent**
* **Discriminative models are usually better than generative models**
* **Work by orthogonal dimensions. Work issue by issue**
* **Work on ideas, not software**
* **Experience is the data of AI**
* **Don’t be impressed by what you don’t understand**
* **Ideas matter, you should care of that**

gitbook对数学公式不是很友好，但是代码高亮不错，决定以后在数学公式方面侧重于用印象笔记记录，部分代码方面有gitbook记录。

聊了很多今晚。
